Asimo was created by Honda's research
and development subsidiary

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:02.850 align:middle line:90%
we were allowed to film their top-secret
robotics laboratory

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:09.780 align:middle line:90%
Japan is a worldwide leader in the
development of humanoid robots

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.590 align:middle line:90%
Asimo is the country's crowning
achievement engineers continue to make

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.850 align:middle line:84%
improvements

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.660 align:middle line:90%
Asimo's most innovative feature is its
advanced intelligence the robot can

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:38.090 align:middle line:90%
think and act on its own without human
intervention that's made possible by

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.230 align:middle line:84%
sensors that replicate our five senses

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.710 align:middle line:84%
Asimo's head contains eight microphones

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.330 align:middle line:90%
it uses them to listen and engage in
conversation

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:03.650 align:middle line:90%
two cameras work his eyes they can
detect humans and you store data to

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.260 align:middle line:84%
identify them

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.780 align:middle line:90%
official recognition problem I don't
think so

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.519 align:middle line:90%
please cover your face Asimo artificial
intelligence analyzes a vast array of

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:28.540 align:middle line:90%
information that's how it understands
people's request and takes appropriate

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.069 align:middle line:84%
actions

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.700 align:middle line:90%
Asimo also has a sophisticated sense of
touch its fingers can make subtle

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:48.389 align:middle line:90%
movements like a person's sensors are
embedded in the fingertips to they can

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:55.540 align:middle line:90%
gauge the hardness of an object like
human fingers do

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:04.810 align:middle line:90%
most robots use a fixed amount of
strength to grab things but a single

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.579 align:middle line:90%
exerts more power to open a tightly
sealed water bottle and less when

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.079 align:middle line:84%
holding a paper cup

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:15.250 align:middle line:90%
it's artificial intelligence uses
information from the fingertips sensors

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.040 align:middle line:84%
to adjust the grip

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.240 align:middle line:90%
the developers ultimate goal is for
awesome oh to be a valuable partner that

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.370 align:middle line:84%
coexists with humans

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:32.310 align:middle line:90%
the engineers who created Asimo all grew
up watching animated shows about robots

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.060 align:middle line:84%
such as

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.250 align:middle line:90%
Astro-boy that I'm own and Gundam they
dreamed of someday making their own

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.450 align:middle line:90%
Satoshi she gave me is the development
teams leader he has been designing

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:56.430 align:middle line:90%
robots for the past 16 years from the
beginning we wanted to design a robot

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.750 align:middle line:90%
that could help people to realize that
dream

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.650 align:middle line:90%
we are constantly asking ourselves what
kind of robot would be able to change

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.470 align:middle line:90%
society make people happy and make life
easier for people around the world

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.670 align:middle line:90%
our idea is to create a robot that will
change how people live

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.590 align:middle line:90%
we're working through the technological
issues one by one in order to reach that

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.260 align:middle line:84%
goal

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:31.750 align:middle line:90%
nos vemos advanced physical capabilities
are revolutionary the robot can walk and

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:43.090 align:middle line:90%
run it can reach speeds of up to nine
kilometers an hour for robots

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.540 align:middle line:84%
walking is much easier than running

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:55.170 align:middle line:90%
when running both be momentarily leave
the ground balancing in midair is no

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.849 align:middle line:84%
easy task

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:09.860 align:middle line:90%
we really gonna kill maintaining posture
while jumping or floating in the air was

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.069 align:middle line:84%
a major technological breakthrough

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:20.869 align:middle line:90%
Asimo liens its upper body slightly
forward to maintain overall balance it

00:06:20.869 --> 00:06:28.069 align:middle line:90%
goes forward straight forward straight
in the air sensor is an awesome most

00:06:28.069 --> 00:06:33.469 align:middle line:90%
waste measure the robots angle it leans
slightly to compensate forward or back

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:35.149 align:middle line:84%
side to side

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:41.409 align:middle line:90%
that's how it stays perfectly balanced
in the air

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.369 align:middle line:90%
asimo has been evolving ever since
development began in nineteen eighty-six

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:50.369 align:middle line:84%
much like a growing child
